I was an **OI (Olympiads in Informatics)** participant during high school. I have series of blog posts on OI problem solutions [here.](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/31098/article) (Mostly in Chinese)

I was one of the main organizers of [Codeforces Round #641](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/76895). This round is known (and maybe infamous) for a bunch of challenging combinatorial counting and construction problems.

I used to be interested in **computer graphics**, especially in physical simulation. 

I was fortunate to intern remotely at UC San Diego under supervision of [Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). During the internship, I completed a mini project on efficient GPU simulation of elastic rods. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Caro23333/PD-rod/).

I also collaborated with another classmate and completed a CPU-based path tracing render. (Unfortunately, since it's a course project, the repository is hidden to avoid plagiarism.)

I'm interested in **video games**, particularly visual novels and rhythm games. Some of my recommendation: _Steins;Gate_, _428 Shibuya Scramble_, _Arcaea_, _OSU!Mania_. I also have internship experience at NetEase as game engine developer.

I love music. My favorite genre is **metal**, especially **progressive (extreme) metal** and **melodic death metal**. Some of my favorite albums:

- _Dream Theater - Awake (1994)_
- _Opeth - Ghost Reveries (2005)_
- _Mors Principium Est - Dawn of the 5TH Era (2014)_
- _Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase (2015)_
- _Obscura - Akróasis (2016)_
- _Horror of Pestilence - Calling To The King Of Black (2018)_
