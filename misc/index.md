I used to be interested in **computer graphics**, especially in physical simulation. 

I was fortunate to intern remotely at UC San Diego under supervision of [Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). During the internship, I completed a mini project on efficient GPU simulation of elastic rods. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Caro23333/PD-rod/).

I also collaborated with another classmate and completed a CPU-based path tracing render. (Unfortunately, since it's a course project, the repository is hidden to avoid plagiarism.)
