I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at [IIIS (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, currently pursuing Bachelor degree in computer science. 

My research interest lies in **theoretical computer science**, particularly in **computational complexity** as its interplay with other fields of computer science, e.g., fundamentals of cryptography. I'm actively seeking a PhD position to continue my exploration in these topics. 

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Igor Carboni Oliveira](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/). Before that, I was introduced to the fascination of computational complexity by [Prof. Yilei Chen](http://www.chenyilei.net/cryptography-s2024.html) in his [course](http://www.chenyilei.net/cryptography-s2024.html).

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_26Fall.pdf), and reach out to me by _lyucaro1369 at gmail dot com_.
