I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at [IIIS (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, currently pursuing Bachelor degree in computer science. 

My research interest lies in **theoretical computer science**, particularly in **computational complexity** as its interplay with other fields of computer science, e.g., fundamentals of cryptography. 

Although my understanding is still limited, I'm fascinated by the following topics:

- **Meta-complexity** and its applications to foundational questions in cryptography and complexity theory;
- **Pseudorandomness construction and derandomization**, as well as their applications;
- **Circuit complexity**, especially frontier techniques and limitations on proving lower bounds. 

I'm actively seeking a PhD position to continue my exploration in the broad landscape of theoretical computer science. 

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Igor Carboni Oliveira](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/). Before that, I was introduced to the fascination of computational complexity by [Prof. Yilei Chen](http://www.chenyilei.net/) in his [course](http://www.chenyilei.net/cryptography-s2024.html).

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_26Fall.pdf), and reach out to me by [Gmail](mailto:lyucaro1369@gmail.com) or [Tsinghua Email](mailto:lv-jy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
