excerpt: 'We investigate central questions in complexity theory through the lens of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, focusing on their extended notions in nondeterministic or randomized settings, for example, $$\mathsf{nK}$$, $$\mathsf{rnK}$$ and $$\mathsf{pnK}$$. 
We proved super-polynomial unconditional lower bounds for $$\mathsf{nK}$$ and $$\mathsf{rnK}$$. 
We investigated Symmetry of Information (SoI) property on $$\mathsf{pnK}$$, showed a gap between the average-case SoI and worst-case SoI which relates closely to the substantial $$\mathsf{NP}$$ vs. $$\mathsf{coAM}$$ problem. 
Generalizing the nondeterministic notions to higher levels of polynomial hierarchy, we showed that investigating the complexity of approximating the complexity measure in different parameter settings is necessary to understand average-case easiness of $$\mathsf{PH}$$.'
